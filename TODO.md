# Blog Laravel

## TODO
 - User-friendly tool to add new users as blog editor (Registration disabled by default for security reason)
 - Some extra messages, e.g. "Post successfuly added"
 - Search by keywords, by tags
 - Something useful for dashboard, e.g. number of published posts and drafts
 - Styles
 - SEO/SMM meta tags
 - SLUG
 - Delete confirm
 - After form validation don't forget to update tests
 - More tests
 - API responses should be cached. Yes, it is just simple requests to MongoDB at that moment, but who knows what will happends later with that project
 - Convert all blog post with tags-as-string to tags-as-array and remove fallbacks (fron-end and back-end)
